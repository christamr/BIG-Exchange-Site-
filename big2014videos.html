						<h2>Workshop 14: Pitching for Venture Support</h2>
						<p class="description">Surprised to find this workshop last on the schedule? Often we think our first step in launching a new idea or solution is to find the people with the money. Hopefully, by the time your team makes it to this workshop, you'll have been pleasantly surprised how much you could accomplish without capital. However, at some point many new initiatives require working capital and pitching for that support is part-art, part-science. Come learn directly from a venture capital leader how to do it right.</p>
